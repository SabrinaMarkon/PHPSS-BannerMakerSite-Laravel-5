- payza for licenses (blech) and IPN
- dlb license programming
- dbl license restrictions
- more graphics
- admin banner pagination
- delete confirmations for things - admin
- banner problem with backgrounds and making a new banner when saved.
- canvas drops under nav too soon. (hor. nav?)


- member/admin session variables!!! - so irritating..weak in this. Seemed to work with the Providers\ComposerServiceProvider but didn't get passed to verification emails (domain, from field, etc.) So
created GlobalConfig middleware which I got to work. Both exist though still.
